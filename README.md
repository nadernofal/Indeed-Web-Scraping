# Indeed-Web-Scraping

I have build a code that automatically scrapes, Indeed job listings using Python, Selenium, Webdriver-manager and Jupyter notebook, 
the function can scrape jobs based on keywords and the number of results that you want to scrape and the output will be saved on
CSV file or Excel file it can be edited easly.
